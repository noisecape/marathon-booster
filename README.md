# Marathon Music 🏃‍♂️🎵

Generate Spotify playlists optimized for your marathon (or any distance) goal time.

## The Idea

Music improves running performance through cadence synchronization, arousal regulation, and distraction from fatigue. This app creates playlists that:

- Match song BPM to your target running cadence
- Follow an energy arc that mirrors race pacing strategy
- Peak when you need it most (hello, mile 20)

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a Spotify app at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run: `flask run`
6. Visit http://localhost:5000

## Status

🚧 POC in development
